        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: October 23, 2025</em></p>

        <h2>1. Subscription Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By subscribing to FluxAntivirus Pro ("the Service"), you hereby acknowledge and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. The Service is provided by FluxTech Solutions LLC, a Delaware corporation registered at 1234 Business Park Drive, Suite 500, Dover, DE 19901.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Trial Period and Billing</h2>
        <p>
            Upon enrollment, you shall be granted access to the Service for an introductory trial period of thirty (30) calendar days at the promotional rate of One Dollar and Zero Cents ($1.00 USD). This initial remuneration is non-refundable under all circumstances, including but not limited to cancellation, dissatisfaction with the Service, technical difficulties, or force majeure events.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> At the conclusion of the aforementioned thirty (30) day trial period, your subscription shall automatically renew and convert to a Standard Plan subscription. The Standard Plan remuneration shall be billed at the current market rate of Ninety-Nine Dollars and Ninety-Nine Cents ($99.99 USD) per calendar month, unless you affirmatively elect to terminate your subscription in accordance with Section 6 herein.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Automatic Renewal</h2>
        <p>
            Unless you provide written notice of cancellation at least seven (7) business days prior to the conclusion of your then-current billing cycle, your subscription shall automatically renew for successive monthly periods. Each renewal period shall commence immediately upon the expiration of the preceding period. You hereby authorize FluxTech Solutions LLC to charge the payment method on file for all applicable subscription fees, including but not limited to monthly recurring charges, upgrade fees, and any applicable taxes or surcharges.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Company reserves the unilateral right to modify, adjust, or increase subscription pricing at any time without prior notice. Any such price modifications shall become effective immediately upon your next billing cycle. Continued use of the Service following any price adjustment shall constitute your acceptance of the new pricing terms.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Payment Authorization</h2>
        <p>
            By providing payment information, you expressly authorize FluxTech Solutions LLC to initiate electronic fund transfers or charges to your designated payment method for all fees associated with your subscription. This authorization shall remain in full force and effect until such time as you properly cancel your subscription in accordance with the procedures outlined in Section 6. You acknowledge that the authorization will remain in effect even if your payment method information changes (e.g., due to card expiration or replacement), and you authorize us to continue charging your payment method using updated information provided by your financial institution.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Non-Refundable Charges</h2>
        <p>
            All fees paid for the Service are final and non-refundable, regardless of usage levels, satisfaction with the Service, or any other circumstances whatsoever. This includes, without limitation, the initial trial fee, monthly subscription fees, annual subscription fees, upgrade fees, and any other charges incurred in connection with your use of the Service. No refunds, credits, or prorated adjustments shall be provided for partial month usage, early cancellation, or any other reason.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Company makes no representations or warranties regarding the suitability of the Service for your particular needs. It is your sole responsibility to evaluate whether the Service meets your requirements prior to subscribing.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>
            To cancel your subscription, you must submit a written cancellation request via our online cancellation portal located at www.fluxtechsolutions.com/cancel, or by sending a certified letter via U.S. Postal Service to our corporate headquarters at the address specified in Section 1. Cancellation requests must be received at least seven (7) business days (excluding weekends and federal holidays) prior to your next scheduled billing date to avoid charges for the subsequent billing period.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that telephone, email, and live chat cancellation requests cannot be processed and will not be considered valid. Furthermore, deletion of the application or software, removal of the payment method from your account, or cessation of use does not constitute a valid cancellation and will not prevent recurring charges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon successful cancellation, you shall retain access to the Service through the conclusion of your then-current paid billing period. No refunds or credits shall be provided for the remaining days of your paid period.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Early Termination Fees</h2>
        <p>
            In the event that you cancel your subscription within the first twelve (12) months of service, you shall be liable for an early termination fee equal to fifty percent (50%) of the remaining monthly payments that would have been due through the end of the twelve-month period. This fee shall be charged to your payment method on file within fourteen (14) business days of your cancellation request being processed.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Service Limitations</h2>
        <p>
            While we strive to provide continuous and uninterrupted service, FluxTech Solutions LLC makes no guarantees regarding the availability, reliability, or performance of the Service. The Company reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (or any part thereof) at any time with or without notice. You agree that the Company shall not be liable to you or any third party for any such modification, suspension, or discontinuance.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Data Collection and Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            By using the Service, you acknowledge and consent to the collection, processing, and storage of various data points, including but not limited to your personal information, browsing history, file system data, system specifications, application usage patterns, and other diagnostic information. This data may be shared with third-party partners, advertisers, and data brokers for purposes including marketing, analytics, and service improvement.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, FluxTech Solutions LLC, its officers, directors, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, use, or other intangible losses, arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the Service, even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
        <p>
            Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Service shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall take place in Dover, Delaware, regardless of your location. You hereby waive your right to participate in any class action lawsuits or class-wide arbitration.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Modifications to Terms</h2>
        <p>
            FluxTech Solutions LLC reserves the right to modify these Terms and Conditions at any time without prior notice. Any modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting to our website. Your continued use of the Service following any such modifications constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for changes.
